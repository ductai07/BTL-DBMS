## How to Apply These Fixes

1. Ensure that the backend API is running and accessible
2. Update the `front_end/src/config/api.js` file with the correct API base URL
3. Verify that all required database tables and fields exist:
   - `ShowTime` table with proper date and time fields
   - `Discount` table with the `discountValue` field for promotions

## Testing the Fixes

### Showtime Page
1. Navigate to the Showtime page
2. Verify that all dropdown select fields display properly with values
3. Verify that dates and times are displaying correctly
4. Test filtering by movie, cinema, and date
5. Try adding a new showtime to ensure it works

### Promotions Page
1. Navigate to the Promotions page
2. Check that discount values are displaying correctly (both percentage and fixed amounts)
3. Verify that promotion statuses are shown with appropriate colors
4. Test adding and editing promotions

### Products Page
1. Navigate to the Products page
2. Test the search functionality by entering a product name
3. Try filtering by category
4. Test adding, editing, and deleting products
5. Toggle between grid and table views to ensure both display correctly
6. Click on a product to view its details in the modal

## Notes for Future Improvements

1. Consider adding more robust form validation in modal components
2. Implement a global state management solution (Redux, Context API) for better data handling
3. Add user authentication features with role-based access control
4. Improve error logging and monitoring
5. Consider implementing data caching to reduce API calls
6. If toast notifications are desired, properly install and configure react-toastify
7. Consider standardizing API response formats across all endpoints

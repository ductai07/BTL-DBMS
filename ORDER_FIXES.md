## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve issues with the Orders functionality in the Cinema Management System. The prior issues included:

1. Unable to create new orders
2. Search functionality not working
3. Unable to view order details

## Components Fixed

### 1. Orders Page (`front_end/src/pages/Orders.jsx`)

#### Changes:
- Updated API endpoints to match the backend implementation
- Fixed search functionality to use the correct search parameters
- Improved customer name display logic to extract from order notes when needed
- Enhanced order status handling to use the correct endpoint for payment processing
- Added proper logging to debug API interactions
- Fixed pagination to update state correctly
- Improved error handling with appropriate user feedback

### 2. Add Order Modal (`front_end/src/component/AddOrderModal.jsx`)

#### Changes:
- Completely refactored to work with the existing SQL Server database schema
- Added product fetching to populate product dropdown
- Implemented a multi-step API interaction:
  1. Create empty invoice
  2. Add products to the invoice
  3. Process payment
- Added error handling with user-friendly messages
- Improved form validation to prevent creating empty orders
- Enhanced UX with loading indicators

### 3. Order Details Modal (`front_end/src/component/OrderDetailsModal.jsx`)

#### Changes:
- Updated to display both tickets and products from an order
- Fixed date/time formatting to work correctly with SQL Server date formats
- Improved display of customer information
- Enhanced the order summary section to show proper totals
- Added loading state and error handling

## API Endpoints Used

The implementation now correctly uses the following API endpoints:

1. `GET /invoice` - List all invoices with pagination and filtering
2. `GET /invoice/detail/:id` - Get invoice details including tickets and products
3. `POST /invoice/create` - Create a new empty invoice
4. `POST /invoice/:id/product` - Add a product to an invoice
5. `PATCH /invoice/payment/:id` - Process payment for an invoice

## How to Test

After applying these fixes, test the system by:

1. **Creating an Order**:
   - Click "Tạo đơn hàng" button
   - Fill in customer information
   - Add products using the dropdown
   - Submit the order

2. **Viewing Order Details**:
   - Click the eye icon on any order in the table
   - Verify that the order details, including products and tickets (if any), are displayed correctly

3. **Search and Filter**:
   - Use the search box to find orders by customer name
   - Use the status dropdown to filter orders by status
   - Verify that pagination works correctly

## Additional Notes

- The system now handles the case where customer information might be stored in the `note` field
- Status updates are limited to changing from "Chưa thanh toán" to "Đã thanh toán"
- Adding tickets to orders requires additional implementation on the frontend (not included in this fix)
